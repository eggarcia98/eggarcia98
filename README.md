Software engineer who learned (the hard way) that things work great in diagrams  
and behave very differently in production 😅   
</br></br>
I build backend services, deploy them to the cloud,  
and then spend time making sure they *don’t* break when users actually show up.

## 🛠 What I usually do (between bugs)

- Build backend services that look simple until they’re not 🐛  
- Deploy containerized apps and whisper nice things to Docker ☁️  
- Tune databases so they stop screaming at peak hours 🗄️  
- Debug issues across software, infrastructure, and networking  
- Fix problems caused by “it worked on my machine” 🔧  

---

## 🛠️ Tech I trust (most days)

**💻 Backend**
- TypeScript / Node.js (Fastify, Express)
- REST APIs
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Queries that start fast and slowly get… creative

**☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure**
- Docker (sometimes friendly, sometimes not)
- Google Cloud (Cloud Run, IAM)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)
- Bash scripts that definitely deserve comments

**🌐 Networking**
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- VLANs, switching
- Routing (OSPF, EIGRP)
- Debugging network issues without unplugging everything (most of the time)

## 🗄 Stuff I’ve built (that survived production)

> Most of my work lives in private repos because companies like their secrets 🔒

- **HL7 Data Proxy (Cloud Run)**  
  Stateless service that turns HL7 medical device output into JSON.  
  Built so critical medical data keeps flowing even when something inevitably breaks 🐞

- **Live Database Migration (MySQL → PostgreSQL)**  
  Automated a live migration while the business was running.  
  No downtime, lots of validation, and *way* too much coffee ☕☕☕

- **ERP Middleware (Odoo)**  
  Scheduled sync jobs that reduced accounting issues  
  and saved humans from doing the same thing twice (everyone wins).

## 📚 Background (the serious part, briefly)

- Advanced Diploma in Telecommunications Engineering (in progress)  
- Bachelor’s degree in Telematics Engineering  
- Experience in healthcare systems, cloud platforms, and ops-heavy teams

I like building systems that are reliable, understandable,  
and fixable at 3am — preferably before the coffee runs out ☕😴
